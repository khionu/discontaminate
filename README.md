# Discontaminate

How much chaos in your Discord?

## What is this?

This is a WIP project designed to check a Discord server for problems, quirks, and other issues of note that could be better configured. Each check is described as a single "lint", checking your server for a single problem, and describe how to fix.

## Why Elixir?

Ease of concurrency, allowing many lints to be evaluated at the same time.
